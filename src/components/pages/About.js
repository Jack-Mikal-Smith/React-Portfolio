      <h1>About Me - Jack Smith</h1>
      <p>
        I received my A.A. degree from Tallahassee Community College as well as two certificates in Small Business Management and Fincaial Analysis. I have also received two certificates from Seminole State College for Business Entrepreneurship and Financial Operations. Most recently, I completed UCF's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. The bootcamp was focused on the MERN libraries and provided me with great insight into both front-end and back-end Web Development. You can view some of my complete sites in the Projects tab. My resume and contact information are provided as well.
